# Installing geckodriver on linux

First, download the binary file in  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

With the binary downloaded, we need to extract the file with the command:
> sudo tar -xvf geckodriver-v0.28.0-linux64.tar.gz

After that, move de extracted file to the directory /usr/local/bin/:
> sudo mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/

It's done.
